-----------------
* Add `Eq1` instances for `Approximate` and `Mass`.
* Allow building with `hashable-1.4.*`.
* Drop support for pre-8.0 versions of GHC.

0.3.4 [2021.02.21]
------------------
* Fix the build with `safecopy-0.10.4` or later.

0.3.3 [2021.02.17]
------------------
* Allow building with `lens-5.*`.
* The build-type has been changed from `Custom` to `Simple`.
  To achieve this, the `doctests` test suite has been removed in favor of using
  [`cabal-docspec`](https://github.com/phadej/cabal-extras/tree/master/cabal-docspec)
  to run the doctests.

0.3.2 [2019.09.13]
------------------
* Allow building with `safecopy-0.10`.

0.3.1
-----
* Add a library dependency on the `doctests` test suite

0.3
---
* Replace use of `Hashable1` from `hashable-extras` in favor of `Hashable` from
  `hashable-1.2.5.0`. As a result, the `hashable-extras` dependency has been removed.
* Revamp `Setup.hs` to use `cabal-doctest`. This makes it build
  with `Cabal-2.0`, and makes the `doctest`s work with `cabal new-build` and
  sandboxes.

0.2.2.3
-------
* Added support for `safecopy` 0.9 and `cereal` 0.5

0.2.2.1

* Bumped `cereal` bounds

0.2

* Removed the `data-default` dependency
* Increased range of supported versions of `generic-deriving`.

0.1.1
-----
* Ported `Data.Approximate.Numerics` from [analytics](http://github.com/analytics)

0.1
---
* Ported `Data.Approximate.Type` and `Data.Approximate.Mass` from [analytics](http://github.com/analytics)
